# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes land on the latest `1.x` release. Older lines are not patched — the
upgrade path from any `0.x` beta to `1.0.0` is a fresh `composer create-project`, since
the betas were never covered by a compatibility promise.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x     | :x:                |

### What a security fix may change

A vulnerability fix may break a contract listed in [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md),
even in a patch release. When that happens the change is called out explicitly in
`CHANGELOG.md` under `Security`, with the reason and the upgrade path. Everything else
follows the normal semantic-versioning rules in that document.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in DALT.PHP, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **Email**: ibnuafdel@gmail.com
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Location** - File path and line number if possible
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of concept** or exploit code (if available)
- **Impact** - What an attacker could achieve
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

### What to Expect

1. We'll acknowledge receipt of your report
2. We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. We'll develop and test a fix
4. We'll release a security patch
5. We'll publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Users

If you adapt DALT.PHP for a deployed project, treat the following as a starting checklist rather than a production guarantee:

### 1. Environment Configuration

```bash
# .env file
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
```

### 2. Database Security

- Use prepared statements (DALT.PHP does this by default)
- Never expose database credentials
- Use strong database passwords
- Limit database user permissions

### 3. Authentication

- Use an adaptive password hash (the auth example uses `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`)
- Keep the example's 8–72 byte password boundary or choose and document a policy appropriate to your hash algorithm
- Add rate limiting to login attempts; DALT's educational auth example does not provide it
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set secure session cookies

### 4. Input Validation

- Validate all user input
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- Attach DALT's CSRF middleware to every state-changing browser route

### 5. File Permissions

```bash
# Secure permissions
chmod 755 public/
chmod 644 .env
chmod 755 storage/
```

### 6. Keep Dependencies Updated

```bash
composer update
npm update
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Educational Purpose

DALT.PHP is designed as a **learning platform** with intentionally broken code in challenges. The challenges demonstrate common security vulnerabilities for educational purposes.

**Important**:
- Challenge code is isolated and not used in the main application
- The framework demonstrates selected security mechanisms but is not production-hardened
- Always review and understand code before using in production

### Production Use

While DALT.PHP can be used as a foundation for real projects:

1. **Remove challenge code** - Run `php artisan platform:remove --force`. This deletes
   `.dalt/`, including every intentionally vulnerable challenge fixture, and leaves the
   framework and your application intact.
2. **Review all code** - Audit before deploying
3. **Add additional security layers** - Rate limiting, WAF, etc.
4. **Follow security best practices** - See above
5. **Keep updated** - Watch for security releases

## Security Features

DALT.PHP includes these small, inspectable mechanisms:

- Parameterized credential lookup in the authentication example
- Password hashing with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` and timing-safe verification through `password_verify()`
- Session-ID rotation before authenticated state is recorded
- Strict, cookie-only sessions with HttpOnly and SameSite cookie configuration
- Auth/guest and CSRF middleware that applications attach explicitly
- A local-only, single-use intended redirect after login
- Strict input-validation helpers

These mechanisms do not include login throttling, password reset, email verification, multi-device logout, roles/policies, an account lockout strategy, or a complete output-escaping system.

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow **responsible disclosure** practices
- Security fixes are released as soon as possible
- We credit researchers who report vulnerabilities (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Confirmed vulnerabilities are published as
  [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Ibnu-Afdel/DALT.PHP/security/advisories)
  on this repository once a fix is available
