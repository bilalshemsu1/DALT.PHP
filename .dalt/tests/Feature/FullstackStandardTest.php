/**
 * The authoring standard, enforced.
 *
 * Two lesson formats coexist while owner amendment C is rolled through Parts 00–11.
 * Historical lessons retain the old §97 checks until their batch starts. A lesson
 * declaring `Lesson format: Concise theory` follows the smaller contract in
 * docs/dalt-fullstack-theory/PIPELINE.md instead. Build milestones keep their own
 * historical standard.
 *
 * This file is the check. A standard that lives only in a document degrades across
 * thirty-two lessons; a standard that fails the suite does not.
 *
 * Every assertion here is mechanical — presence, length, shape. None of it can judge
 * whether a lesson is any good. That is what the audit checkpoints in PIPELINE.md are
 * for. This only guarantees that nothing was silently skipped.
