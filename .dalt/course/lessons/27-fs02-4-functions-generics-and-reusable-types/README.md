## Why this matters

So far every type we've written has described one shape. This lesson is about types that describe a **relationship between** shapes — "whatever goes in comes out," "this container holds one of those," "these same keys, but all optional."

That sounds abstract and turns out to be intensely practical. Without it, we write the same type three times under three names, and the three copies quietly drift apart. With it, one declaration says the relationship once and the compiler propagates it everywhere: change `Issue`, and every dependent type follows along, or fails loudly right at the place that needs a real decision.

The trap runs the other way too, and it's worth naming up front: generics used as decoration. `<T>` on a function that only ever receives an `Issue` adds a type parameter, a mental cost, and nothing else. The real skill here is knowing **when a relationship is real** — so this lesson spends just as much time on "use the concrete type instead" as it does on `<T>`. It's also the longest lesson in Part 02, on purpose; take the pause point when you get to it.

## Before you start

Required:

- FS02.3 — Unions, narrowing and `unknown`.
- Node and npm, and an editor with TypeScript support.

Recommended first:

- FS01.1's treatment of functions as values. A function type is that idea written down.
- This is the densest lesson in Part 02 — it has the longest estimated effort of the
  five for a reason. It's built in two halves: functions and generics first, utility
  types and `keyof` second. There's a natural pause point between them, marked when
  you get there. Splitting this across two sittings is a completely normal way to take it.

New words this lesson uses, if any of them are unfamiliar:

```text
generic          a type written with a placeholder, like <T>, that gets filled in
                 by whatever the caller actually passes
type parameter   the placeholder itself — the T in <T>
constraint       a rule narrowing what a type parameter is allowed to be,
                 e.g. <T extends { id: number }>
utility type     a built-in type that builds a new type from one you already have
                 (Pick, Omit, Partial, Record)
keyof            "the union of this type's property names," as a type
```

Going deeper in DALT Core — optional:

- None.

## By the end

You should be able to:

- write a function's contract — parameters, return, optional and default arguments — and say what each part promises callers;
- type a callback parameter so the caller's function is checked against it;
- decide whether a type parameter preserves a real relationship or is decoration;
- constrain a type parameter to the capability you actually use, and no more;
- build one reusable container type and narrow it with the tools from FS02.3;
- derive a related type from an existing one instead of redeclaring it;
- use `keyof` and indexed access at small depth without turning the model into a puzzle.

## Predict before reading

Write answers down first.

1. `function first(items: Issue[]): Issue` versus `function first<T>(items: T[]): T`. What can the caller do with the second that the first prevents?
2. A function takes `(items: T[], predicate: (item: T) => boolean)`. If you call it with `Issue[]`, what type does the compiler give `item` inside your inline callback?
3. `<T extends { id: string }>`. What does that let the function body do, and what does it still forbid?
4. You add a required field to `Issue`. Which is more useful — a hand-written `IssueSummary`, or one derived from `Issue`?

Question 1 is the difference between a real relationship and a `<T>` that does nothing.

## Mental model

Before the precise version: think of `<T>` as a labeled box, not a magic word. Whatever
you put into the box is what you get back out — the label doesn't care what's inside,
it just keeps track of it. A function isn't "generic" because it has `<T>` on it any
more than a box is useful because it has a label; it's generic because something you
put in on one side is the same something that comes out on the other, and the label is
just how TypeScript keeps that promise honest.

Precisely: a generic is a **promise to preserve a connection**, not a way to accept more things:

```text
concrete       (items: Issue[]) => Issue
               one shape in, one shape out — fine when there is only ever one shape

generic        <T>(items: T[]) => T
               "whatever element type you give me is the element type you get back"
               the compiler carries the caller's actual type through
```

The test for whether you need one: **is there a connection between two positions that would be lost if you wrote the concrete type?** If input and output types move together, that is a relationship — use a parameter. If the function only ever handles issues, the relationship is "it is an issue", and the honest way to say that is `Issue`.

Constraints are the same idea narrowed. `<T extends { id: string }>` says "any type, provided it has an id" — it buys you access to `.id` inside the body while keeping the caller's exact type on the way out. Constrain to the capability you use; anything more is a restriction you never needed.

## Begin with concrete code, then preserve a real relationship

The JavaScript version does not promise anything about the item it returns:

```js
function first(items) {
  return items[0];
}
```

If the array contains issues, you know the result is probably an issue by convention.
TypeScript can make that convention explicit:

```ts
function firstIssue(items: Issue[]): Issue | undefined {
  return items[0];
}
```

That concrete function is honest when it only handles issues. A generic becomes useful
when the same relationship should work for many item types:

```ts
function first<T>(items: T[]): T | undefined {
  return items[0];
}

const firstIssue = first(issues); // Issue | undefined
const firstName = first(names);   // string | undefined
```

The `<T>` is not decoration. It remembers the caller's element type and carries it to
the result. For a beginner, this rule is enough: **write the concrete version first;
make it generic only when you can point to the relationship being preserved.**

## Preserve a relationship on purpose

FS02.1 asked what TypeScript knows before runtime. FS02.2 asked which values our application permits. FS02.3 asked what TypeScript knows at this exact control-flow point.

This lesson asks: **how do types preserve useful relationships through functions and reusable code?**

Set up a fresh, course-owned lab. It is not the future Issue Tracker.

~~~sh
mkdir -p .dalt/workspace
cp -R .dalt/course/fullstack/typescript-functions-lab/starter .dalt/workspace/fs02-4-typescript-functions-lab
cd .dalt/workspace/fs02-4-typescript-functions-lab
npm ci
~~~

Keep the loop small: read, predict, change, typecheck, hover, run, explain, then change a requirement and repair it. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run run` are clean checks. The `stage:*` commands intentionally show a compiler error; a non-zero result there is evidence for the experiment, not a final failure.

## A function is a contract

Open `src/functions.ts`. Start with the ordinary domain function:

~~~ts
function findIssueById(
  issues: Issue[],
  id: number
): Issue | undefined
~~~

Read it as a contract between caller and implementation:

~~~text
parameter types → values allowed in
function body    → assumptions the implementation may make
return type      → result promised to callers
~~~

The caller may provide an issue array and numeric id. The body may use those facts. Every return path must produce an `Issue` or `undefined`.

### Predict: does this branch satisfy the promise?

Before opening the diagnostic, predict whether a branch returning `'not found'` satisfies `Issue | undefined`.

~~~sh
npm run stage:return-contract
~~~

It does not. Do not immediately widen the return type to `Issue | undefined | string` just to silence the diagnostic. First choose behavior: should absence be `undefined`, a `Result<Issue>`, or a thrown error? Each is a different contract.

For the simple lookup, `undefined` is coherent. Later in this lab, `findIssueResult` deliberately changes the requirement to `Result<Issue>` so callers must narrow `ok` before reading `value`. That retrieves FS02.3’s discriminated-union reasoning. A generic result type does not prove anything about external data; FS02.5 owns that trust boundary.

Write one small local helper without a return annotation, hover it, and record its inferred return type. Then add a return annotation only if the boundary becomes meaningful: an exported/public contract, a useful guard against drift, a complex boundary, or an exercise requirement. Inference is often enough locally; “annotate every function” is not a rule.

## Functions are values too

Retrieve FS01.1: a function can be passed around like data. A function type expression describes the shape of a callable value:

~~~ts
type IssuePredicate = (issue: Issue) => boolean;

function filterIssues(issues: Issue[], predicate: IssuePredicate): Issue[]
~~~

Predict all three calls before running the stage: an inline callback that returns a boolean, a callback expecting a `number` instead of an `Issue`, and a callback returning a title string.

~~~sh
npm run stage:callbacks
~~~

The inline callback gets its `issue` parameter from context. The second callback asks for the wrong input; the third does not produce the required boolean. Keep callback contracts this practical: they make transformations and filters understandable now, and prepare you for later library callbacks without introducing React.

Optional parameters are appropriate only when callers may genuinely omit an argument. For example, `formatIssue(issue, prefix?: string)` can reasonably choose a default prefix. A required `id` should not become optional merely to avoid an error. Rest parameters are useful when a function intentionally collects a variable number of same-kind values:

~~~ts
function summarizeTitles(...issues: Issue[]): string[] {
  return issues.map((issue) => issue.title);
}
~~~

Hover `summarizeTitles`: callers pass zero or more `Issue` values, not an arbitrary array shape. This is the practical depth needed here.

## Reuse a relationship, not a word

Suppose we write these two functions:

~~~ts
function firstIssue(issues: Issue[]): Issue | undefined
function firstProject(projects: Project[]): Project | undefined
~~~

What actually differs? The element type. A weak abstraction loses that fact:

~~~ts
function first(items: unknown[]): unknown
~~~

Predict why `unknown[] → unknown` is weaker. It accepts the array, but callers no longer know that an `Issue[]` produces `Issue | undefined` or that a `Project[]` produces `Project | undefined`.

Now inspect the lab version:

~~~ts
function first<T>(items: T[]): T | undefined
~~~

`T` does not mean “anything.” It means “whatever the element type is here; preserve that relationship in the result.”

~~~text
Issue[]   → T = Issue   → Issue | undefined
Project[] → T = Project → Project | undefined
~~~

Call `first(issues)` and `first(projects)` in `src/exercise.ts` without writing `<Issue>` or `<Project>`. Hover both calls. What did TypeScript infer for `T`? Prefer inference when the argument already supplies enough evidence.

## Generic or concrete?

Before reading on, decide which candidates should be generic and why.

~~~ts
function findIssueByStatus(issues: Issue[], status: IssueStatus): Issue | undefined
function first<T>(items: T[]): T | undefined
function getIssueTitle<T>(issue: T): string
function findById<T extends { id: number }>(items: T[], id: number): T | undefined
~~~

`first` preserves a real input/output relationship. `findById` does too: it returns the same kind of item supplied. `findIssueByStatus` communicates a domain operation and is clearer as concrete code. `getIssueTitle<T>` is over-generic: `T` does not provide `title`, and no useful relationship is being preserved. Simplify it to `getIssueTitle(issue: Issue): string` if the operation is specifically about issues, or use a minimal honest constraint only if multiple shapes really need it.

Use these rules:

1. A type parameter should usually connect multiple meaningful positions.
2. Prefer fewer type parameters and inference.
3. Add a constraint only when the body needs a capability.
4. A domain-specific function may be clearer when concrete.
5. Do not generalize before a repeated relationship exists.

Ask: **what does `T` connect?** If there is no answer, the generic may be decoration rather than design.

## Constrain only the capability you need

`findById` should work for `Issue`, `Project`, and a future `UserSummary`, but it needs `item.id`. Predict whether an unconstrained `T` can access `.id`, then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:constraint
~~~

The error says the generic promise is too broad. Repair the idea, not the symptom:

~~~ts
function findById<T extends { id: number }>(
  items: T[],
  id: number
): T | undefined
~~~

`T` still varies, but every allowed item guarantees the one capability the implementation needs. In `src/exercise.ts`, hover calls with issues and projects. Then try a local `type Label = { text: string }` array: it should be rejected. Do not over-constrain `T` to `Issue` when `id` is the only needed capability.

## One reusable container, plus familiar narrowing

The lab’s small application type is:

~~~ts
type Result<T> =
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: string }
~~~

It preserves one useful relationship: `Result<Issue>` contains an Issue on success, while `Result<Project>` would contain a Project. The failure shape stays stable. In `exercise.ts`, hover `result` and then each branch of `result.ok ? result.value.title : result.error`. FS02.3 already taught why the boolean literal narrows the union.

This is an example, not a mandate to build a giant `Result` abstraction into every future file. A concrete `Issue | undefined` is still better when absence is ordinary and callers need no error explanation.

## Model related types from a real relationship

`Issue` has fields including `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, and `createdAt`. Describe the relationship in words before selecting a utility type.

- `IssueSummary` intentionally selects `id`, `title`, and `status`, so `Pick<Issue, 'id' | 'title' | 'status'>` documents a subset.
- `NewIssue` initially omits generated `id` and `createdAt`, so `Omit` expresses that relationship in this tiny model. Ask whether server-owned `status` or another field would differ before assuming `Omit<Entity, 'id'>` is always a create contract.
- An update may edit only title, description, status, and priority. First make `EditableIssue` with `Pick`, then make `IssuePatch = Partial<EditableIssue>`. `Partial<Issue>` would incorrectly permit `id` and `createdAt` updates.

Independently writing `IssueSummary` can be clearer when it is an independent contract that merely happens to resemble `Issue`. Derive only when the relationship is true; do not make unreadable derivation chains to avoid a few clear lines.

`Required<IssueDraft>` is a small recognition experiment: it changes optional draft fields into required fields in the type system. It does not validate a runtime draft. `Readonly<IssueSummary>` retrieves FS02.2: it describes read-only use, not `Object.freeze()`, deep immutability, or runtime enforcement.

## Let a finite model expose its dependents

The status labels use a complete mapping:

~~~ts
const statusLabels: Record<IssueStatus, string> = { ... }
~~~

`Record<IssueStatus, string>` says every known status needs a string label. Add `'blocked'` to the stage’s `IssueStatus` union, then run this deliberately broken stage before repairing the mapping:

~~~sh
npm run stage:utility-model-change
~~~

The missing `blocked` label is a real old assumption, not compiler noise. Add a deliberate label, then typecheck again. This is different from FS02.3’s exhaustive switch: here a finite union is a dependency map for object keys.

## Keys and property types, at small depth

First, a `string` key can ask for nonsense. `keyof Issue` instead represents the union of Issue’s actual property keys. The bounded reusable helper is:

~~~ts
function readField<T, K extends keyof T>(value: T, key: K): T[K]
~~~

Predict which keys `readField(issues[0], ...)` accepts, then hover calls using `'status'` and `'notAField'`. The selected key also controls the return type. `T[K]` is indexed access: “the type of property K on T.” Recognize the simpler form too:

~~~ts
type Status = Issue['status'];
~~~

It reuses the property type. Stop here: this helper is useful precisely because it remains readable; no keyof puzzle or type-level machinery is needed.

## Try it

**Prediction:** `first<T>(items: T[]): T | undefined` preserves whatever element type it is
given. Before running anything, predict whether it accepts a `readonly Issue[]` — the kind
FS02.2 taught you to reach for when a list should resist reassignment — the same way it
accepts an ordinary `Issue[]`.

**Run / inspect:**

```ts
function first<T>(items: T[]): T | undefined {
  return items[0];
}

const readonlyIssues: readonly Issue[] = issues;

first(readonlyIssues);
```

**What happened:** it is rejected — `Argument of type 'readonly Issue[]' is not assignable
to parameter of type 'Issue[]'. The type 'readonly Issue[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be
assigned to the mutable type 'Issue[]'.` Change the parameter to `items: readonly T[]` and
both a `readonly Issue[]` and an ordinary `Issue[]` are accepted.

**Why:** `T[]` is a promise that the function may treat its argument as mutable — nothing in
`first`'s body actually reassigns an element, but the *type* does not say that, so
TypeScript will not silently drop the caller's `readonly` guarantee to let the call through.
This is the same lesson FS02.2 taught about `readonly` being a real, checked contract, now
showing up at a second boundary: a generic function's parameter type is exactly as strict
about mutability as a concrete one, because `T` is still standing in for a real type, not an
escape hatch from the rules the rest of this lesson establishes. Preferring `readonly T[]`
for a function that only reads its input is the more reusable default for exactly this
reason.

## Common mistakes

### `<T>` where a concrete type was meant

A type parameter used in exactly one position preserves no relationship. `function label<T>(issue: T): string` is `function label(issue: Issue): string` with extra ceremony and less checking. Answer to question 1: the generic version keeps the caller's element type on the way out; if the function only ever handles issues, that buys nothing.

### Over-constraining

`<T extends Issue>` when the body only reads `.id` locks out every other shape that would have worked. Constrain to the capability, not to the domain type.

### Under-constraining, then asserting

`<T>` with `(item as { id: string }).id` inside. If the body needs an id, say so in the constraint and let the compiler enforce it at the call site.

### Redeclaring instead of deriving

A hand-written `IssueSummary` and an `Issue` will drift the first time one changes. Answer to question 4: derive it, so the change surfaces as a diagnostic rather than as two types that quietly disagree.

### Utility types stacked until nothing is readable

`Partial<Pick<Omit<Issue, 'id'>, 'title' | 'status'>>` typechecks and cannot be read. If a derived type needs a comment to explain it, write the type out. Depth is not sophistication.

### Generic parameters named for their position

`<T, U, V>` on the same signature. Name them for what they mean — `<TIssue, TResult>` — as soon as there is more than one.

### Treating any of this as runtime behaviour

Generics are erased with everything else. `<T>` cannot construct, validate, or inspect a `T` at runtime. FS02.5 next.

## When this goes wrong

1. **The compiler inferred `unknown` for a type parameter.** Nothing at the call site pinned it. Pass a value that determines it, or supply it explicitly.
2. **A callback's parameter is implicitly `any`.** The function type is missing or too loose; type the callback parameter in the signature and inference flows into the caller's inline function. Answer to question 2: the compiler gives `item` the type `Issue`.
3. **A generic function will not accept a valid argument.** The constraint is wider than the body needs, or narrower than the argument satisfies. Read which side the diagnostic is complaining about.
4. **A derived type has a property you expected to be gone.** Check whether you wanted `Omit` or `Pick`, and remember `Partial` makes properties optional rather than removing them.
5. **An error points inside a utility type.** Read it from the outside in: what did you ask for, what did the compiler produce, where did they stop agreeing.

## Focused exercise — evolve typed issue utilities

**Mode: self-reported practice using your editor, TypeScript, and Node. This exercise is not automatically verified.**

Start with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run run`. Work in `src/functions.ts` and `src/exercise.ts` as one evolving issue/project utility set.

1. **Function contracts.** Temporarily make a return path in `findIssueById` return `'not found'`; predict and inspect the error. Decide whether the function should keep `Issue | undefined` or use `Result<Issue>`. Restore the former, then use `findIssueResult` for the latter and update its caller by narrowing `ok`.
2. **Callbacks.** Add one valid inline `filterIssues` callback. Predict why a `(issue: Issue) => issue.title` callback fails. Do not turn the predicate into `unknown` or `any`.
3. **Generic judgment.** Write down why `first` is generic, why `findIssueById` stays concrete, and why `function titleOf<T>(value: T): string` is over-generic. Simplify the last function to an Issue-specific function.
4. **Useful constraint.** Use `findById` with issues and projects, hover both results, and try it with `{ text: string }[]` to observe the rejection. Explain which capability the constraint needs.
5. **Related models.** Use `IssueSummary`, `NewIssue`, and `IssuePatch`. Before writing `IssuePatch`, list fields that must remain protected. Confirm that a patch cannot include `id` or `createdAt`. Explain whether the `NewIssue` omission is truly the create contract for this model.
6. **Model change.** Add `'blocked'` to `IssueStatus` in the normal lab code. Run `npm run typecheck` before changing `statusLabels`. Classify the failure, add a label, and rerun typecheck. Do not weaken the mapping to `Record<string, string>`.
7. **Keys and indexed access.** Use `readField` with one valid key and one invalid key, then explain the inferred valid result. Add `type StatusAgain = Issue['status']` and say why it might avoid duplicated property unions.
8. Finish with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run run`. Keep no `any`, blind assertion, non-null assertion, conditional type, custom mapped type, overload, or class abstraction.

### Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1 — generic judgment</summary>

What relationship are you trying to preserve?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2 — generic judgment</summary>

Does the type parameter appear in more than one meaningful position? Could a concrete domain type communicate this more clearly?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3 — constraint</summary>

Which property does the implementation need? What minimum shape guarantees it?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4 — utility types</summary>

Describe the relationship first: selected subset, omission, optional editable version, or complete keyed mapping. Then choose `Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, or `Record`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reference explanation — reveal after an honest attempt</summary>

`findIssueById` is concrete because it expresses an issue-domain operation; `first<T>` preserves the element/result relationship across many collections. `findById` needs only `{ id: number }`, so its constraint is honest and still returns the caller’s concrete item type. `Result<T>` preserves the success-value relationship and its `ok` field enables FS02.3 narrowing.

`Pick` fits an intentional summary; `Omit` fits this small create shape only while every remaining field is genuinely client-supplied; `Partial<EditableIssue>` protects generated fields better than `Partial<Issue>`; `Record<IssueStatus, string>` intentionally makes a new status break an incomplete label map. An independent type is clearer when the supposedly related model has its own contract.
</details>

## Debug reusable TypeScript deliberately

When a function or reusable type goes wrong, ask: What contract does this function claim? What does every return path produce? What did inference say before annotation? What relationship does each type parameter connect? Which minimum capability does the body require? Would concrete code be clearer? Is a derived type expressing a real domain relationship? Did a model change expose a dependent assumption? Am I about to add `any`, `as`, or `!` only to hide useful feedback?

## Closed-book checkpoint

Answer before revealing the comparison answers.

1. When is an explicit return type useful, and when can inference be enough?
2. What does `(issue: Issue) => boolean` describe?
3. What relationship does `T` preserve in `first<T>(items: T[]): T | undefined`?
4. Why is that stronger than `unknown[] → unknown`?
5. What does `T extends { id: number }` mean in `findById`?
6. Why can a reusable-looking issue function be better concrete than generic?
7. When do `Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, and `Record` express useful relationships?
8. Why can `Partial<Issue>` be a poor update contract?
9. What does `keyof T` represent, and why can a new union member intentionally break a `Record` mapping?
10. Transfer: a function accepts an object and returns its `name`. Should it be `function nameOf<T>(value: T): string`? Explain the constraint or concrete design you would choose.

<details>
<summary>Reveal comparison answers</summary>

1. Use one for a meaningful public/complex boundary or to prevent drift; local implementation can often rely on inference.
2. A callable contract: it receives an Issue and returns a boolean.
3. The array element type and returned item type.
4. `unknown` loses the caller’s element/result relationship.
5. T may vary, but every allowed value supplies a numeric id.
6. A concrete domain function can state its intent more clearly when no reusable relationship needs preserving.
7. They express a selected subset, a true omission, an intentionally optional shape, and a complete mapping over known keys.
8. It can make protected/server-owned fields writable.
9. It is a union of known keys; `Record` requires each union member as a key, so the new member exposes the missing mapping.
10. Not unconstrained: the body needs `name`. Use `<T extends { name: string }>` only if multiple shapes truly need it, otherwise use the concrete domain type.
</details>

## In the project

### DALT connection — reusable frontend contracts, separate backend code

The browser will eventually work with several issue-shaped values: a full issue, a
small list summary, and a form draft. Utility types can express a relationship without
copying every field:

```ts
type Issue = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  status: 'backlog' | 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'done';
};

type IssueDraft = Omit<Issue, 'id'>;
type IssuePatch = Partial<IssueDraft>;
```

These types help TypeScript code in the browser stay consistent. They do not generate
PHP classes, database columns, or HTTP validation. DALT still validates the request on
the server, and FS05 will make the database rules explicit. The useful relationship is
between frontend values—not a promise that two languages share one type definition.

The reusable container you build here — a `RequestState<T>` or equivalent — is the shape **B02** declares and Part 04 fills in for real. It's also your first sight of a pattern that dominates the rest of the course: one type describing "an operation over some payload," narrowed at the point of use.

Everything ahead is an instance of the same idea. `useState<Issue[]>` in FS03.2 is a generic call. Part 04's fetch helper preserves the relationship between what you asked for and what you got back. Part 08's TanStack Query result types are the same idea with more surface area. None of it is React magic — it's this lesson's `<T>`, worth actually understanding before a library hands it to you pre-assembled and lets you forget it's there.

## You are done when

- [ ] Every function I wrote has a contract I can explain to a caller.
- [ ] I typed a callback parameter and watched inference flow into an inline function.
- [ ] For each `<T>` I kept, I can name the two positions whose relationship it preserves.
- [ ] I removed at least one type parameter that preserved nothing.
- [ ] My constraints match the capability the body uses, not the domain type.
- [ ] I derived a related type from `Issue` rather than redeclaring it, and saw a model change propagate.
- [ ] No `as` was used to work around a constraint.
- [ ] I attempted the closed-book checkpoint without notes.

FS02.5 remains unavailable until this lesson is complete. It addresses separately how runtime data becomes trustworthy — nothing here does that.

- Versions: TypeScript 5.9.3, Node 25 (CR-08 pinned toolchain)
- Consulted: 2026-08-19
- DALT files inspected: `.dalt/course/fullstack/typescript-functions-lab/starter/**`
- Curriculum authority: `CURRICULUM.md` §12 FS02.4 — the boundary is reusable relationships, not advanced type-level programming (`VISION_AND_SCOPE.md` §19)
- Laravel bridge: not applicable — generics have no DALT or Laravel counterpart
- Beginner-accessibility pass: 2026-08-19 — added a new-vocabulary table, a plain-language analogy for generics, an explicit mid-lesson pause point separating functions/generics from utility-types/keyof, and a voice pass toward first-person-plural framing (owner request, informed by cross-check against Full Stack Open's TypeScript course structure); structure, exercises, and required sections unchanged
