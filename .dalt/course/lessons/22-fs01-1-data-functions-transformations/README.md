## Why this matters

Part 00 established that browser JavaScript can take part in application behavior. Here, we’re going to focus on the language mechanisms application code actually uses to shape data before it reaches a screen or changes state.

You already know how to program — this is a focused refresher for the JavaScript patterns we’ll keep meeting in TypeScript and, later, React: issue lists, callback functions, derived values, deliberate updates.

One of them matters more than the rest. React decides whether to re-render by comparing references, so "did I change this array, or did I produce a new one?" stops being a style question and becomes the difference between a screen that updates and one that silently doesn’t. That’s why we’re spending this lesson’s time on references and immutable updates, rather than on syntax we could just look up.

## Before you start

Required:

- FS00.1 and FS00.2.
- Node available (`node --version`), or a browser console — every snippet here runs in either.

Recommended first:

- Keep a scratch file or console open. This lesson is prediction-driven and the predictions are worthless unless you write them down before running anything.

Going deeper in DALT Core — optional:

- None.

## By the end

You should be able to:

- explain why objects and arrays can be shared through references;
- use functions as stored, passed, and returned values;
- use destructuring, spread, and rest without assuming spread deep-copies data;
- choose `map`, `filter`, `find`, `some`, `every`, or `reduce` by the result you need;
- create an updated array or object without mutating the value you started with.

## Predict before reading

Write your predictions down first. Only run each snippet once we’ve committed to an answer.

### 1. Shared object reference

```js
const issue = { title: 'Broken search', status: 'open' };
const selectedIssue = issue;

selectedIssue.status = 'closed';

console.log(issue.status);
console.log(issue === selectedIssue);
```

What are the two outputs? More importantly: how can changing `selectedIssue` affect `issue` when neither binding was reassigned?

### 2. Is this really a copy?

```js
const project = {
  name: 'Atlas',
  settings: { notifications: true },
};
const nextProject = { ...project };

nextProject.settings.notifications = false;

console.log(project.settings.notifications);
console.log(project.settings === nextProject.settings);
```

Predict both outputs. Do not call this a deep copy until you have tested the nested value.

### 3. Passing a callback, or calling it?

```js
const announce = () => console.log('Issue updated');

const later = (work) => {
  console.log('before');
  work();
};

later(announce);
// What changes if this becomes later(announce())?
```

Which line calls `announce` in the working version? In the changed version, what is passed into `later`?

### 4. Transformation prediction

```js
const issues = [
  { id: 1, status: 'open', title: 'Broken search' },
  { id: 2, status: 'closed', title: 'Update docs' },
];

const result = issues
  .filter((issue) => issue.status === 'open')
  .map((issue) => issue.title);

console.log(result);
```

Predict the value and shape of `result`. Which callback chooses items, and which one changes their shape?

### 5. An update without changing the input

```js
const issues = [
  { id: 1, status: 'open' },
  { id: 2, status: 'open' },
];

const nextIssues = issues.map((issue) =>
  issue.id === 2 ? { ...issue, status: 'closed' } : issue,
);

console.log(issues[1].status, nextIssues[1].status);
console.log(issues === nextIssues, issues[1] === nextIssues[1]);
```

Predict all four values. Why is it useful that the changed issue and the containing array have new identities?

## Mental model

Two ideas carry this whole lesson.

**A binding is a name pointing at a value. For objects and arrays, the value is a reference.**

```text
const a = { title: 'Broken search' }
const b = a                     ← b points at the SAME object
b.title = 'Fixed'               ← a.title is now 'Fixed' too

const c = { ...a }              ← c points at a NEW object
c.title = 'Something else'      ← a is untouched
```

`const` only stops the *name* from being re-pointed — it says nothing about the object that name points at.

**A transformation produces the next value; it does not edit the current one.**

```text
current value  ──transformation──▶  next value
     (unchanged)                      (new reference)
```

`map`, `filter`, and spread work this way. `push`, `sort`, and direct property assignment don’t. Both styles are valid JavaScript — only one survives contact with React, which is exactly why we’re building the habit now, four lessons before we need it.

## Values, bindings, and references

In this course we default to `const`, and reach for `let` only when a binding genuinely needs reassigning. Neither keyword makes an object immutable.

```js
const issue = { status: 'open' };
issue.status = 'closed';       // allowed: the object changed

// issue = { status: 'open' }; // not allowed: the const binding cannot point elsewhere
```

Primitive values — strings, numbers, booleans — behave like values we can just replace. Objects and arrays are reference values: a variable holds a reference to an object or array that lives elsewhere. Assigning that reference doesn’t create another object.

```text
issue ───────────┐
selectedIssue ───┴──→ { status: 'open' }
```

That’s why prediction 1 prints `closed` and `true`. It’s not spooky shared state — both bindings just refer to the same object.

### Copying deliberately, and the shallow boundary

Spread makes a new outer object or array.

```js
const issue = { id: 7, status: 'open' };
const nextIssue = { ...issue, status: 'closed' };

const queue = [issue];
const nextQueue = [...queue, nextIssue];
```

This is a **shallow** copy. The outer container is new; nested objects and arrays stay the same references unless we also copy the branch we’re changing.

```js
const project = { name: 'Atlas', settings: { notifications: true } };
const nextProject = {
  ...project,
  settings: { ...project.settings, notifications: false },
};

console.log(project.settings.notifications);     // true
console.log(project.settings === nextProject.settings); // false
```

Don’t reach for deep cloning as a habit. Copy the specific path whose next value differs — that keeps the transformation clear and leaves unrelated values alone.

## Functions are values

A function can be stored, passed around, returned, and called later. Function declarations read best when a name matters; arrow functions stay compact when the function is just a value inside an expression.

```js
function formatIssue(issue) {
  return `#${issue.id} ${issue.title}`;
}

const formatTitle = (issue) => issue.title.toUpperCase();
const applyToIssue = (issue, formatter) => formatter(issue);

console.log(applyToIssue({ id: 4, title: 'Broken search' }, formatIssue));
console.log(applyToIssue({ id: 4, title: 'Broken search' }, formatTitle));
```

`formatter` is a callback: `applyToIssue` receives it now and calls it later. `formatIssue` passes the function itself as a value. `formatIssue()` calls it immediately, so what gets passed is the return value instead. That distinction matters for array methods now, and for event handlers soon.

### A practical closure

When a function is created, it keeps access to its lexical environment. It can run later and still reach values from that surrounding scope.

```js
const makeStatusFilter = (status) => {
  return (issue) => issue.status === status;
};

const isOpen = makeStatusFilter('open');
const issues = [{ status: 'open' }, { status: 'closed' }];

console.log(issues.filter(isOpen));
```

`isOpen` was created while `status` was `'open'`. When `filter` calls it later, the inner function still has access to that `status`. This pattern — create a function configured with some data, then hand it off to be used later — is a closure.

## Shape data with destructuring, spread, and rest

Destructuring names the values we need without repeated property access.

```js
const issue = { id: 8, title: 'Fix search', status: 'open', priority: 'high' };
const { title, status } = issue;
const [firstIssue] = [issue];

const describe = ({ id, title }) => `#${id} ${title}`;
console.log(describe(firstIssue));
```

Rest gathers remaining items or properties.

```js
const { priority, ...issueWithoutPriority } = issue;
const addLabels = (issue, ...labels) => ({ ...issue, labels });
```

Read the direction carefully: spread expands values out into a new literal or call; rest gathers the remaining values back in, during destructuring or parameter collection.

## Choose the operation that states the intent

Before reading the answers, choose one operation for each requirement:

1. Return only open issues.
2. Find issue 17.
3. Does any issue have high priority?
4. Are all closed issues assigned?
5. Produce a title for every issue.
6. Calculate issue counts grouped by status.

<details>
<summary>Compare your choices</summary>

1. `filter`: selection may produce zero or many issues.
2. `find`: one matching issue, or `undefined`.
3. `some`: “at least one?”
4. `every`, usually after selecting closed issues: `issues.filter(isClosed).every(hasAssignee)`.
5. `map`: transform every item into a corresponding title.
6. `reduce`: accumulate a single grouped-count object.
</details>

```js
const issues = [
  { id: 17, title: 'Broken search', status: 'open', priority: 'high', assignee: 'Mina' },
  { id: 18, title: 'Refresh docs', status: 'closed', priority: 'low', assignee: null },
];

const openIssues = issues.filter((issue) => issue.status === 'open');
const issue17 = issues.find((issue) => issue.id === 17);
const hasHighPriority = issues.some((issue) => issue.priority === 'high');
const titles = issues.map(({ title }) => title);
const countsByStatus = issues.reduce((counts, issue) => ({
  ...counts,
  [issue.status]: (counts[issue.status] ?? 0) + 1,
}), {});
```

`reduce` earns its place when we need one accumulated result, like grouped counts — it’s not a badge of sophistication. Reach for `map`, `filter`, `find`, `some`, or `every` whenever one of those names already says exactly what we mean. Use `find` instead of `filter(...)[0]`, for instance, when what we actually want is one item.

## Current value → transformation → next value

JavaScript allows mutation. We’re deliberately practising transformations that produce a next array or object instead, because application state gets easier to inspect this way: we can compare the old and new value, know exactly which branch changed, and avoid surprising some other reference that was pointing at the same data.

```js
const closeIssue = (issues, issueId) =>
  issues.map((issue) =>
    issue.id === issueId ? { ...issue, status: 'closed' } : issue,
  );
```

This returns a new array. It keeps the unchanged issue objects exactly as they were, and creates a new object only for the one being changed. It’s an intentional, shallow update — not a claim that JavaScript itself is immutable.

## Try it

**Prediction:** `closeIssue` above returns a new array using `map`. Before running anything,
predict whether the *unchanged* issue objects inside that new array are the same references
as the ones in the original array, or new objects too.

**Run / inspect:**

```js
const issues = [
  { id: 1, status: 'open' },
  { id: 2, status: 'open' },
];

const closeIssue = (issues, issueId) =>
  issues.map((issue) =>
    issue.id === issueId ? { ...issue, status: 'closed' } : issue,
  );

const next = closeIssue(issues, 1);

console.log(issues === next);
console.log(issues[1] === next[1]); // the untouched issue, id 2
console.log(issues[0] === next[0]); // the changed issue, id 1
```

**What happened:** the outer array is a new reference (`issues === next` is `false`), the
untouched issue object is the *same* reference in both arrays, and only the changed issue is
a new object.

**Why:** `map` always returns a new array, but the callback above only builds a new object
for the id that matches — every other iteration returns the exact value it received. This
isn’t an accident worth losing: it’s the reason `closeIssue` stays cheap to call on a large
list, and it’s exactly the signal a reference-comparing re-render check needs later — an
unrelated issue's row can skip re-rendering because its object identity provably didn’t
change, something a full deep clone of every issue would have destroyed without touching a
single visible value.

## Focused exercise — Issue triage report

**Mode: self-reported practice with your own Node or browser-console evidence. This exercise is not automatically verified.**

Let’s create a small file — `issue-triage.js` works, outside this repository — or just use the browser console. Start with this fixture:

```js
const issues = [
  { id: 17, title: 'Broken search', status: 'open', priority: 'high', assignee: { name: 'Mina' }, labels: ['bug'] },
  { id: 18, title: 'Refresh docs', status: 'closed', priority: 'low', assignee: { name: 'Noah' }, labels: ['docs'] },
  { id: 19, title: 'Slow export', status: 'open', priority: 'medium', assignee: null, labels: ['performance'] },
  { id: 20, title: 'Invite email typo', status: 'closed', priority: 'high', assignee: null, labels: ['bug', 'email'] },
];
```

Write small functions that, from this one dataset:

- return open issues;
- find an issue by ID;
- report whether any issue is high priority;
- report whether every closed issue has an assignee;
- derive counts grouped by status;
- close one issue by ID without mutating the input array or its original issue object.

Then run this experiment before repairing it:

```js
const copiedIssues = [...issues];
copiedIssues[0].assignee.name = 'Changed by accident';

console.log(issues[0].assignee.name);
console.log(issues[0] === copiedIssues[0]);
```

Observe the unexpected result, and explain which reference is still shared. Repair the update so only the relevant issue and its `assignee` branch receive copies — when changing an assignee’s name, for example. Finally, prove with `console.log` or assertions that the original `issues` fixture is untouched after both updates.

### Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: where should I inspect?</summary>

Before and after each operation, inspect the result and the original fixture. For the copy bug, compare both the outer array and the nested objects with `===`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2: which concept matters?</summary>

`[...issues]` creates a new array, but it does not copy each issue object or each nested assignee object.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3: what small experiment can I perform?</summary>

Log `issues === copiedIssues`, `issues[0] === copiedIssues[0]`, and `issues[0].assignee === copiedIssues[0].assignee`. Each comparison answers a different question.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4: an implementation clue</summary>

For an assignee-name update, map over the array. For the matching issue, return `{ ...issue, assignee: { ...issue.assignee, name: nextName } }`; return the original issue for non-matches.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reference explanation — reveal after a meaningful attempt</summary>

One valid approach uses `filter`, `find`, `some`, and `reduce` for the first five requirements, because each method names the needed result. An immutable close uses `map`: return a copied issue with a new status only for the matching ID.

The reference bug occurs because array spread copies only the array container. Its first element still refers to the original issue, whose `assignee` still refers to the original nested object. The repair copies each changed level: new array, changed issue object, and changed assignee object. Equivalent implementations are valid if they preserve the original fixture and express the same behavior.
</details>

## When this goes wrong

When a transformation surprises us, run through this small loop:

1. Inspect the input before the transformation.
2. Inspect the returned value—not only the screen or final log.
3. Check whether the original changed.
4. Compare identities with `===` when references may be shared.
5. Reduce the transformation to one item.
6. Inspect what the callback receives and what it returns.

This is especially useful for a missing `return` in a callback, a predicate that selects the wrong items, or a nested update that copied too little.

## Common mistakes

- **“`const` makes the object immutable.”** It prevents rebinding, not property mutation.
- **Using `map` to select.** If the requirement is “only these items,” use `filter`.
- **Using `filter(...)[0]` for one item.** `find` communicates that intent directly.
- **Treating spread as deep cloning.** It copies one container level.
- **Calling a callback while trying to pass it.** `onSave` and `onSave()` are different values.
- **Using `reduce` when a named operation is clearer.** Clarity is the point.
- **Thinking a closure copies values forever.** It retains access to its surrounding lexical environment; the useful question is which binding the function can still access.

## In the project

This is **B01 — JavaScript readiness**. No issue-tracker code gets written here — what carries forward is the reasoning.

Every one of these operations reappears later with a name attached. `issues.filter(...)` becomes FS03.2's derived `visibleIssues`. `issues.map(...)` becomes FS03.1's list rendering and FS03.2's immutable status update. Functions passed as values become FS03.3's `onCreate` callback. And the reference rule turns load-bearing: React compares old and new state by identity, so mutating an array in place gives us data that changed and a screen that didn’t.

TypeScript and React add vocabulary on top of this. They don’t replace any of it.

## Closed-book checkpoint

Close the lesson and answer before reopening the details below.

1. Why can a `const` variable still refer to a mutable object?
2. Explain the difference between `map` and `filter` using an issue list.
3. When is `find` clearer than `filter`?
4. What does object or array spread copy, and what does it leave shared?
5. What makes a closure possible?
6. A function receives an array of issues and must answer “does at least one issue have no assignee?” Which operation expresses that question, and why?
7. Why might an application deliberately create a new array or object instead of mutating the current one?

<details>
<summary>Check your recall</summary>

1. `const` fixes the binding, not the object it references.
2. `map` returns one transformed output per input; `filter` returns only inputs whose predicate is true.
3. Use `find` when one matching item (or no item) is the meaningful result.
4. Spread copies the outer array/object only; nested objects or arrays stay shared until specifically copied.
5. A function can access bindings in the lexical environment where it was created, even when called later.
6. `some`, because the result is an “at least one?” boolean.
7. New values make changes explicit, avoid accidental shared-reference effects, and make state easier to compare and reason about.
