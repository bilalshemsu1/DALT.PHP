## Why this matters

The issue tracker's `Issue` type is not documentation. It is the definition of which application states are allowed to exist — and every part of this course downstream inherits it. React props in Part 03, request and response shapes in Part 04, table columns and constraints in Part 05, authorization decisions in Part 06: all of them are this model, re-expressed at another layer.

A weak model costs you at every one of those layers. `status: string` means every component, every handler, and every query has to defend against values the application never designed for — and eventually one of them will not. A finite union means the invalid state cannot be written down in the first place.

So the skill here is not syntax. It is **deciding what is true about your domain and saying it precisely enough that the compiler can hold you to it.**

## Before you start

Required:

- FS02.1 — The TypeScript mental model.
- Node and npm, and an editor with TypeScript support.

Recommended first:

- Have FS02.1's two-column model in mind. Everything here is still source-level; nothing you write today validates a runtime value.
- If `type`, `interface`, or `readonly` is new vocabulary, do not memorize a rule
  list. Start with the question: **which values should this application allow?**

Going deeper in DALT Core — optional:

- [Database fundamentals](/learn/lessons/05-database) shows the same modelling questions expressed as columns and constraints. Optional, and Part 05 teaches what it needs.

## By the end

You should be able to:

- decide whether a field is required, optional, or nullable — and say why those are three different things;
- restrict a field to a finite set of valid values instead of `string`;
- use `readonly` to express an invariant, and state what it does not do;
- choose between a type alias and an interface without inventing a rule;
- reuse an existing shape rather than redeclaring it;
- model a related entity as a nested object instead of a flattened field;
- read a wave of compiler errors after a model change as a list of stale assumptions.

## Predict before reading

Write answers down first.

1. `assigneeId?: number` and `assigneeId: number | null`. What does each say about an issue with nobody assigned?
2. A field is `readonly`. Can the object still be changed at runtime?
3. `status: string` versus `status: 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'done'`. Which mistakes does the second prevent that the first cannot?
4. You change one property on a widely used type. Is the resulting pile of errors a problem or information?

Question 1 is the one that decides whether your API shapes are honest in Part 04.

## Mental model

A type is a claim about which values are possible:

```text
string                 ← every string that has ever existed
'todo'|'in_progress'   ← exactly two values your application designed
```

Widening a type is not "being flexible." It is enlarging the set of states your code must handle, usually without handling them. Narrowing is not "being strict." It is recording a decision you already made.

Three distinctions do most of the work, and they are genuinely different:

```text
required     the property is always there
optional     the property may be absent          ← "we might not know"
nullable     the property is there, value null   ← "we know: nobody"
```

"Absent" and "explicitly nothing" are different facts. Conflating them produces APIs where you cannot tell "not loaded" from "empty", which becomes a real bug the first time a partial update is sent in Part 05.

## Translate one JavaScript object into a contract

You already know how to create an object in JavaScript:

```js
const draft = {
  title: 'Fix search',
  priority: 'high',
};
```

The object has values now. A TypeScript type describes the shape other code may rely
on:

```ts
type IssueDraft = {
  title: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
};

const draft: IssueDraft = {
  title: 'Fix search',
  priority: 'high',
};
```

The type does not create `draft`, fill in a missing property, or validate JSON. It is a
contract for code the checker can see. If a later value comes from a form or DALT, it
must still be treated as runtime data and checked at that boundary. That distinction
is why this lesson models the application's decisions now, while FS02.5 teaches how
to earn trust in values that arrive later.

When choosing a type, ask these three beginner questions in order:

1. What does this value mean in the domain?
2. Which states are actually valid?
3. Which of those states can the current code prove?

## Start with a model, not syntax

FS02.1 established that TypeScript reasons about source before JavaScript runs. Now give it something useful to reason about: the states our application allows.

Set up this course-owned lab. It is not the future Issue Tracker.

~~~sh
mkdir -p .dalt/workspace
cp -R .dalt/course/fullstack/typescript-modeling-lab/starter .dalt/workspace/fs02-2-typescript-modeling-lab
cd .dalt/workspace/fs02-2-typescript-modeling-lab
npm ci
~~~

Open src/modeling.ts. The opening object-shaped data carries assumptions: an identifier is a number, a title is text, a status means something, and a person may or may not be assigned. JavaScript alone accepts many values that would make those assumptions meaningless.

The work in this lesson is a repeated decision:

~~~text
real application concept
        ↓
decide which states are valid
        ↓
describe those states with TypeScript
        ↓
let the compiler compare code with that model
~~~

Types are not decoration on JavaScript. A good type is a decision about the application.

## Give an issue a required shape

An issue always needs an id, title, and status. In src/modeling.ts, predict what happens if one of those properties is omitted from an Issue value, then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:required
~~~

The diagnostic identifies a missing required property. Read it as a model question: the value lacks title, while the required object shape promises title.

Now add a temporary Issue value in src/modeling.ts with id, title, and status, run this command, and then remove the temporary value:

~~~sh
npm run typecheck
~~~

The existing Issue type is a type alias. A type alias can name an object shape, a union, or another type expression. Its point here is not the keyword; it is the contract.

Primitive fields describe the simplest decisions:

- title: string means title text;
- id: number means numeric identity;
- isPinned: boolean would mean one of two states.

Do not add annotations merely because TypeScript has syntax. Add them where the application needs a stable contract.

### Try one primitive decision

Imagine the triage screen needs to know whether an issue stays at the top. Add isPinned: boolean as a required Issue field, add isPinned: false to triageIssue, and run npm run typecheck. Then predict whether true also works and whether 1 does. Change the value, inspect the feedback, and leave the model with an honest boolean.

### Model a collection by its members

The issue also needs a list of watcher ids. Add watcherIds: number[] to Issue and watcherIds: [4, 8] to triageIssue. Run npm run typecheck. The array decision is not “some list”: it is a list whose every member is a numeric user id. Try one non-number long enough to see the diagnostic, then repair it.

## Optional is not the same as empty

The current model says description? is optional. Before running anything, predict these three values:

~~~ts
{}
{ description: 'Explain the failure.' }
{ description: undefined }
~~~

Now run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:optional
~~~

This lab deliberately enables exactOptionalPropertyTypes. Under that rule, description?: string means the property may be absent; when it is present, it must be a string. So omission and an actual undefined value are different. The null example also fails: null is not a string.

This is not a universal style rule. It is a project choice made visible in tsconfig.json. The useful modeling question is always: what does the contract mean?

Add this allowed optional description to triageIssue, typecheck it, then remove it:

~~~ts
description: 'Search results need a clearer empty state.',
~~~

~~~sh
npm run typecheck
~~~

Now compare that with an assignee. Suppose every issue always has an assignee field, but an issue can have nobody assigned. That model is not optional:

~~~ts
assignee: UserSummary | null
~~~

Absent means the property is not there. Undefined can mean a present value is undefined, depending on the model and compiler rules. Null can deliberately mean “this field exists, and its application value is no person.” Neither is automatically better; the domain contract decides.

## Let an invariant resist reassignment

An issue id should not be casually reassigned. Predict the result, then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:readonly
~~~

The checker rejects assignment through a readonly property. Add readonly to the id field of one object type you write in this lesson, then try the assignment yourself and remove it after reading the diagnostic.

~~~ts
issue.id = 99
~~~

readonly is a TypeScript usage restriction. It is not Object.freeze(), does not make nested values deeply immutable, and does not add runtime protection. JavaScript still receives ordinary objects after type erasure.

## Restrict a real domain

The starter says IssueStatus is string. Ask what that permits: done, banana, an empty string, and values the application never designed.

Replace its definition in src/modeling.ts with this finite domain:

~~~ts
export type IssueStatus =
  | 'backlog'
  | 'todo'
  | 'in_progress'
  | 'done';
~~~

Run typecheck. Then predict and run the deliberately bad source:

~~~sh
npm run stage:status
~~~

A literal union is useful here because the product has a finite status vocabulary. The narrower type removes meaningless states from the program. It is not prettier syntax; it records a domain decision.

## Use both object declarations

The starter uses an interface for UserSummary and a type alias for Issue. Both can describe ordinary object shapes. Neither becomes a runtime constructor, object, or class.

At this stage, use the declaration that makes the local contract clear:

- type is useful for object shapes and for the IssueStatus union;
- interface naturally describes an object contract and has interface-specific extension and merging behavior.

This is not a style war. Changing an equivalent interface to a type alias does not change emitted JavaScript. FS02.1 already showed why: both declarations are erased.

## Reuse a shape you already have

FS02.1 introduced structural typing. Use it now. src/modeling.ts has a richerIssue with id, title, status, and priority, then assigns it to the smaller IssueSummary shape.

Before running, predict whether the extra properties prevent compatibility:

~~~sh
npm run stage:structural
~~~

It succeeds. TypeScript normally checks whether the required structure exists; it does not require named membership. Compare required members before inventing a conversion.

## Model related data, not just flat fields

An assignee is a small related object, not merely a string label. Predict what is wrong in each source example, then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:nested
~~~

The first nested value has a string where UserSummary requires a numeric id. The second has no name. The compiler is comparing the nested contract too.

Do not turn that observation into runtime validation. These are source values TypeScript can see. Later we will treat values that arrive from outside the program as a separate problem.

## Try it

**Prediction:** `readonly` "does not make nested values deeply immutable," this lesson
already told you. Before running anything, predict which of these two lines the checker
rejects, and which one it accepts:

```ts
type Issue = {
  readonly id: number;
  assignee: { name: string };
};

const issue: Issue = { id: 1, assignee: { name: 'Mina' } };

issue.id = 2;
issue.assignee.name = 'Noah';
```

**Run / inspect:** `npx tsc --noEmit --strict` on a file containing exactly this.

**What happened:** `issue.id = 2` is rejected — `Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a
read-only property.` `issue.assignee.name = 'Noah'` typechecks cleanly.

**Why:** `readonly` restricts reassigning the *property itself* on the object that declares
it. `assignee` is not `readonly`, and its own `name` field is not either, so nothing stops
you from reaching through the unprotected property and mutating what it points to. This is
the concrete shape of "shallow": a `readonly id` is a real, enforced contract about
`issue.id` specifically, not a claim about everything reachable from `issue`. If an
invariant needs to hold deeper than one level, every level that matters needs its own
`readonly`, and even then — this lesson already said it, and now you have seen it — none of
it exists once JavaScript runs.

## Common mistakes

### `string` where a finite set was meant

The default mistake. `status: string` accepts `'Done'`, `'don'`, and `''`, and pushes the checking into every consumer. Severity: high — the cost lands in Part 03's components and Part 05's queries, far from the decision.

### Using optional to mean "no value"

`assigneeId?: number` says the property might not be there. If your domain says an issue always has an assignee field and `null` means unassigned, write `assignee: UserSummary | null`. Answer to question 1: optional is about the *property*, nullable is about the *value*.

### Optional everywhere, so nothing has to be supplied

A model where every field is optional describes no state at all, and every consumer needs a guard. Optionality is a claim; make it only where it is true.

### Expecting `readonly` to freeze an object

It prevents assignment *through a typed reference in your source*. It is erased, so it does not freeze anything at runtime and does not apply deeply. Answer to question 2: yes, the object can still be changed at runtime — by JavaScript that never saw the type.

### Inventing a type-alias-versus-interface rule

Both describe object contracts and both disappear. Be consistent within the project and spend the decision budget on the model instead.

### Flattening a related entity

`assigneeName: string` plus `assigneeId: number` splits one thing into two fields that can disagree. A nested `UserSummary` cannot half-exist.

### Widening the model to make errors stop

After a change, the fastest way to a green check is to loosen the type until nothing complains. That deletes the information the errors were carrying. Answer to question 4: the pile is information — a map of every assumption the change invalidated.

## When this goes wrong

1. **One change produced twenty errors.** Expected, and useful. Read them as a list, decide per site whether the caller or the contract is wrong, and fix the contract once.
2. **An optional property still errors when you read it.** Strict mode is asking you to handle the absent case. That is the point of declaring it optional.
3. **`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` rejects assigning `undefined`.** With that flag, optional means absent-or-value, not present-with-`undefined`. Omit the property rather than setting it to `undefined`.
4. **A literal union rejects a value that looks right.** Check for case and whitespace; `'Todo'` is not `'todo'`.
5. **`readonly` did not stop a mutation.** Something reached the object through an untyped path, or the mutation is nested one level deeper than the modifier applies.

## Focused exercise — evolve one honest issue model

**Mode: self-reported practice using your editor and tsc. This exercise is not automatically verified.**

Open src/exercise.ts. Its initial model is deliberately small and should typecheck:

~~~sh
npm run typecheck
~~~

Read the initial requirement before changing anything:

- every issue has a readonly numeric id and a title;
- description may be absent;
- status is one of the four stated literal values;
- an assignee, when present, is represented only by a numeric id.

Now the requirement changes. The application needs a displayable assignee name, and every Issue must contain an assignee field. An unassigned issue deliberately uses null.

Do this in order:

1. Predict which current Issue values will stop matching.
2. Change the model first: introduce UserSummary and replace assigneeId? with assignee: UserSummary | null.
3. Run npm run typecheck before repairing the values.
4. For every diagnostic, identify the old assumption it exposed: missing field, old numeric representation, or incorrect nullability.
5. Repair firstIssue with a complete UserSummary and unassignedIssue with assignee: null.
6. Run npm run typecheck again, then npm run run.
7. Add a small richer object and assign it to a smaller summary shape to demonstrate structural compatibility. Do not weaken the new assignee contract to make the old values pass.

Do not answer an honest model change by making everything optional, widening every property, or asserting a value into place. Ask which side reflects the requirement: is the caller old, or is the model false?

### Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1 — begin with the application decision</summary>

The new requirement says every issue carries assignee information. It also gives unassigned a deliberate meaning.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2 — separate the three absence ideas</summary>

The old property could be absent. The new property must exist. Its value is either a complete person summary or null.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3 — choose the TypeScript shapes</summary>

Define an interface or type for UserSummary, then use a required assignee property whose type is UserSummary | null.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4 — repair values coherently</summary>

The assigned example needs an object with numeric id and name. The unassigned example needs assignee: null, not a missing property.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reference explanation — reveal after an honest attempt</summary>

One coherent repair defines UserSummary with readonly id and name, then gives InitialIssue a required assignee: UserSummary | null property. The example with assigneeId: 7 becomes an object such as { id: 7, name: 'Amina' }; the formerly missing field becomes assignee: null.

The diagnostics are useful because they identify places still expressing the old model. Making assignee optional again would make the code green while contradicting the new requirement.
</details>

## Read compiler errors as model feedback

When typecheck fails, work through this protocol:

1. What value/type do I currently have?
2. What type is required?
3. Which property differs?
4. Is the property missing?
5. Is optional, undefined, or null modeled differently?
6. Is a literal outside the allowed domain?
7. Did the requirement change?
8. Is the caller wrong, or is the model wrong?
9. Am I weakening the model just to remove useful feedback?

Common mistakes are symptoms of skipping those questions: using string for a finite domain, treating optional as nullable, assuming readonly freezes JavaScript, expecting named types to be nominal at runtime, over-modeling with dozens of tiny types, or using a tuple when named object fields would communicate better.

## Closed-book checkpoint

Close the lesson, then answer before revealing the comparison answers.

1. An Issue has description?: string. What is different about omitting description and assigning null?
2. In this lab, why does description: undefined fail for description?: string?
3. What does readonly protect, and what does it not do at JavaScript runtime?
4. Why can status: string be a weaker model than a literal union?
5. At ordinary object-shape depth, what practical job can both type and interface do?
6. Why can a richer issue satisfy IssueSummary?
7. After an assignee model changes, what do the resulting compiler errors tell you?
8. A Comment always contains an author field, but comments from deleted users deliberately have no active author. Would you choose author?: UserSummary or author: UserSummary | null? What different meaning does each express?

<details>
<summary>Reveal comparison answers</summary>

1. Omission means the property is absent; null is a deliberate value only if the type allows it.
2. exactOptionalPropertyTypes makes the optional property absent-or-string, not present-with-undefined.
3. It prevents typed source from assigning through that property. It does not freeze the runtime object or deeply freeze nested values.
4. string permits values the application has never designed; a literal union records the finite valid states.
5. Both can describe ordinary object contracts. The choice does not create different JavaScript runtime values.
6. Structural typing checks that the required id and title exist; extra members do not normally block that assignment.
7. They reveal source values and callers that still assume the earlier contract.
8. Use author: UserSummary | null when the field always exists and null deliberately means no active author. Optional means the property itself may be absent.
</details>

## In the project

### DALT connection — the same decision appears in JSON

The issue tracker will eventually have a DALT response shaped roughly like this:

```json
{
  "id": 17,
  "title": "Fix search",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "assignee": null
}
```

The frontend model might say:

```ts
type Issue = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  status: 'backlog' | 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'done';
  assignee: { id: number; name: string } | null;
};
```

This is a useful shared conversation about the domain, but it is not shared executable
code. The PHP endpoint and the browser each have their own implementation and their
own validation. The TypeScript model helps the browser describe what it expects; it
does not prove that the JSON is honest. FS02.5 handles that proof question later.

This model *is* **B02 — Type the future application**, and it does not stop there. The `Issue`, `Project` and `UserSummary` shapes you settle here become FS03.1's component props, Part 04's request and response bodies, and Part 05's table columns — where a finite union turns into a `CHECK` constraint or an enum, and a nullable column stops being a matter of opinion.

That is why Part 02 sits before React. You should not be learning object modelling and React props at the same time, and you should not be discovering in Part 05 that your model was never decided.

## You are done when

- [ ] I predicted each diagnostic before running the stage that produced it.
- [ ] Every finite field in my model is a literal union, not `string`.
- [ ] I can state the difference between required, optional and nullable using a field from my own model.
- [ ] I used `readonly` for an invariant and can say what it does not protect.
- [ ] I modelled a related entity as a nested object rather than flattened fields.
- [ ] I changed one property and repaired the callers by deciding per site, without widening the type to silence anything.
- [ ] I attempted the closed-book checkpoint without notes.

FS02.3 remains unavailable until this lesson is complete. It deepens reasoning about unions and control flow; this lesson was only about deciding which application states are valid.
