# Lesson 16: Advanced PostgreSQL

> **Status: Completed** — The missing-RLS challenge has been fixed and verified.

## Scaling and Security at the Data Layer

As your application grows, doing everything in application code becomes risky and slow. If you build a multi-tenant SaaS, filtering by `tenant_id` in every single PHP query is a bug waiting to happen. If your logs table reaches 100 million rows, `DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'` will lock the table and bring down production.

Postgres has advanced features specifically designed to handle these scale and security issues at the database level.

## Learning Objectives

- Use **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to guarantee tenant isolation
- Use **Range Partitioning** to split massive tables without changing application code
- Understand **`pg_cron`** for scheduling tasks directly inside Postgres

## Predict before reading

Before reading further, write down what you expect for each:

| Question | What do you expect? |
|---|---|
| `ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` runs, but no `CREATE POLICY` follows. Does `SELECT * FROM posts` as an ordinary user return all rows, no rows, or an error? | ? |
| The exact same table, policy, and connection details, but the app connects as `postgres` (a superuser) instead of `app_user`. Does the policy still filter rows? | ? |
| `set_config('app.tenant_id', '5', false)` is called once at the start of a request; a second, unrelated query later in the *same* request reads `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)`. Does it still see `'5'`? | ? |
| A table is `PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at)` into monthly children. You run `DELETE FROM event_logs WHERE created_at < '2024-01-01'` instead of dropping the January partition. Is it as fast as `DROP TABLE`? | ? |
| `pg_cron`'s `shared_preload_libraries=pg_cron` line is left out of `docker-compose.yml`, but `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;` is still run. What happens? | ? |

The second is the one worth being wrong about — it is the exact trap "The trap: RLS does nothing for a superuser" below is named after, and nothing about it produces an error.

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

In a multi-tenant application, users from "Company A" must never see data belonging to "Company B".

The standard (flawed) approach is to add `WHERE tenant_id = :id` to every query in PHP. If a developer forgets that `WHERE` clause on one API endpoint, data leaks.

**Row-Level Security (RLS)** enforces this at the Postgres level. Even if the PHP developer runs `SELECT * FROM posts`, Postgres will intercept it and only return the rows the current tenant is allowed to see.

### Step 1: Enable RLS

First, enable RLS on the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

*(Note: If you enable RLS but create no policies, the default policy is DENY ALL. No rows will be visible.)*

### Step 2: Create a Policy

Create a policy that restricts access based on a session variable:

```sql
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON posts
USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::INT);
```

The `USING` clause defines what rows can be read and updated.
- `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` reads a custom configuration variable. The `true` means "don't throw an error if the setting doesn't exist (return null)".
- `::INT` casts it to an integer to match the `tenant_id` column type.

### Step 3: Set the context in PHP

Before running queries for a specific tenant, tell Postgres who the current tenant is. Do this once per HTTP request (e.g., in your framework's middleware or base controller).

```php
$tenantId = 5; // e.g., determined from the logged-in user or the subdomain

$db->query('SELECT set_config(:key, :value, false)', [
    'key'   => 'app.tenant_id',
    'value' => (string) $tenantId,
]);
```

**Why `set_config()` and not `SET`?** Because `SET` is a utility statement, not a query — PostgreSQL will not accept a bind parameter in it:

```php
$db->query('SET app.tenant_id = :id', ['id' => $tenantId]);
// PDOException: SQLSTATE[42601]: Syntax error ... syntax error at or near "$1"
```

The tempting workaround is to interpolate the value into the string. Do not: that puts user-derived data straight into SQL, in the one feature whose entire job is preventing data from leaking between tenants. `set_config(name, value, is_local)` is an ordinary function call, so the value binds normally. The third argument `false` means the setting lasts for the session rather than only the current transaction.

Now, when you run this query:

```php
$posts = $db->query('SELECT * FROM posts')->get();
```

Postgres automatically rewrites it to effectively be `SELECT * FROM posts WHERE tenant_id = 5`. The isolation is enforced by the database engine.

### The trap: RLS does nothing for a superuser

Everything above is correct and still leaks if you connect as the wrong role.

**Superusers bypass row-level security entirely, and so does the table's owner by default.** No error, no warning — policies are simply not applied. DALT's default configuration connects as `postgres`, which is a superuser, so a policy you have written and enabled will silently do nothing.

Demonstrated on the same table and policy, changing only the connecting role:

```
as superuser 'postgres':   tenant 1 sees: t1-a, t1-b, t2-a     ← isolation absent
as non-superuser 'app_user': tenant 1 sees: t1-a, t1-b
                             tenant 2 sees: t2-a               ← isolation working
```

So the policy is only half the work. The application must connect as an ordinary role:

```sql
CREATE ROLE app_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'change-me';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON posts TO app_user;
```

```env
DB_USERNAME=app_user
DB_PASSWORD=change-me
```

If the application must own the table as well, add `ALTER TABLE posts FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` so the owner is subject to its own policies too.

This is the most important thing to take from this section: **verify isolation, never assume it.** Query as two different tenants and confirm each sees only its own rows. A security control that fails open looks exactly like one that works.

## Partitioning

When a table gets too large (e.g., tens of gigabytes), standard indexes become too large to fit in memory, and deleting old data causes massive I/O spikes.

**Table Partitioning** splits one large logical table into multiple smaller physical tables. Your application still queries the main table as if nothing changed.

### Range Partitioning (e.g., by month)

This is ideal for time-series data like logs, events, or posts.

Create the parent table and declare the partition key:

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_logs (
    id BIGSERIAL,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
```

*(Note: The partition key `created_at` must be part of the primary key constraint if you have one, which complicates things slightly. Often, partitioned event tables don't use primary keys at all.)*

Create the child tables (partitions) for specific date ranges:

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_logs_2024_01 PARTITION OF event_logs
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE event_logs_2024_02 PARTITION OF event_logs
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');
```

When you `INSERT INTO event_logs`, Postgres automatically routes the row to the correct child table.

### Why Partitioning Matters

1. **Partition Pruning:** If you query `WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-15' AND '2024-01-20'`, Postgres entirely ignores `event_logs_2024_02` and scans only the January table. Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see this in action.
2. **Instant Deletion:** To delete data older than January, you don't run `DELETE`. You just drop the partition: `DROP TABLE event_logs_2024_01`. It happens instantly and reclaims disk space immediately with zero locking.

## `pg_cron`

If you need to run a task every hour (e.g., deleting expired sessions, refreshing materialized views), you usually set up a Linux cron job that calls a PHP script.

If the task is purely data manipulation, you can use the `pg_cron` extension to run the job entirely inside Postgres.

### Enabling `pg_cron`

In your `docker-compose.yml`, you must preload the library:
```yaml
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    command: postgres -c shared_preload_libraries=pg_cron
```

Then in Postgres:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
```

### Scheduling Jobs

Delete expired sessions every day at 3 AM:
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule('0 3 * * *', $$DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expires_at < NOW()$$);
```

Check job status:
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## End-of-Phase Project: Multi-Tenant Blog Platform

You have all the building blocks. Your final project is to build a multi-tenant blog platform (like Medium or Substack) using these advanced features.

### Schema Requirements

1. **Tenants:** `id`, `name`, `domain`
2. **Users:** `id`, `tenant_id`, `email`, `password_hash`
3. **Posts:** `id`, `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `title`, `body`, `search_vector`, `created_at`

### Database Architecture Rules

- **Must use RLS:** All queries to `users` and `posts` must be protected by Row-Level Security. Application code should never contain `WHERE tenant_id = ?`.
- **Must use Full-Text Search:** The `posts` table must use a `tsvector` generated column, indexed with GIN, for searching articles.
- **Migrations:** All schema changes must be written as numbered migration files in `database/migrations/`.
- **Connection Pooling:** Your `docker-compose.yml` must include `pgbouncer`. PHP must connect to PgBouncer, not directly to Postgres.

### API Requirements

- Middleware that extracts the `tenant_id` from the request (e.g., from an `X-Tenant-Domain` header) and executes `SET app.tenant_id = ?`.
- `POST /posts` — Create a post.
- `GET /posts` — List posts (paginated). Postgres RLS will automatically ensure they only see their tenant's posts.
- `GET /search?q=docker` — Full text search across the tenant's posts.
- `GET /export` — *(Bonus)* Stream the tenant's posts out as CSV.

## Checkpoint

Close the source files and answer from memory:

1. Explain what happens to `SELECT * FROM posts` for an ordinary role the moment RLS is enabled on the table but before any `CREATE POLICY` exists.
2. State which two kinds of database role bypass RLS silently, and the statement that closes the gap for a table's own owner.
3. Explain why `SET app.tenant_id = :id` cannot take a bind parameter, and name the function that does the same job safely.
4. Explain the difference between `DELETE FROM event_logs WHERE created_at < ...` and `DROP TABLE event_logs_2024_01` on a partitioned table, in terms of locking and disk reclamation.
5. State what "partition pruning" means, and the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` evidence that shows it happened.
6. Explain why "the checks pass" is not sufficient evidence that RLS isolation works, and what you should do instead before trusting it.

## Your Task

Load the broken challenge:

```bash
php artisan challenge:start db-missing-rls
```

A controller `Http/controllers/tenant/posts.php` lists posts for a tenant. It *tries* to isolate data by fetching the tenant ID and doing `WHERE tenant_id = :id`. But if another developer modifies this query later and forgets the `WHERE` clause, data will leak.

You must implement Row-Level Security to protect the data at the DB level.

1. **Fix the Migration:** In `database/migrations/003_enable_rls.sql`, write the SQL to enable RLS on the `posts` table and create a policy that checks `tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::INT`.
2. **Fix the Controller:** In `Http/controllers/tenant/posts.php`, execute `SELECT set_config('app.tenant_id', :id, false)` before the `SELECT` query runs — not `SET app.tenant_id = :id`, which cannot take a bind parameter (see "Step 3: Set the context in PHP" above).
3. **Remove the WHERE clause:** Remove `WHERE tenant_id = :id` from the controller's `SELECT` query to prove that RLS is doing the filtering.

Verify:

```bash
php artisan challenge:verify
```

## Laravel bridge

Compared against Laravel 13.x ([laravel.com/docs/13.x/eloquent#global-scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/eloquent) and [laravel.com/docs/13.x/scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/scheduling), consulted 2026-08-13).

| Laravel 13.x | DALT |
|---|---|
| **Global scopes** — `static::addGlobalScope(new TenantScope)` in a model's `booted()` method, or the `#[ScopedBy([TenantScope::class])]` attribute — silently adds a `WHERE tenant_id = ?` to *every* query Eloquent builds for that model | Row-Level Security adds the equivalent filter *inside Postgres*, so it also applies to raw SQL, `psql`, a forgotten endpoint, or any tool that connects with the right role — Eloquent's global scope only applies inside Eloquent |
| a global scope is **application-layer** enforcement — bypassable with `Model::withoutGlobalScope(TenantScope::class)`, a raw `DB::table()` query, or a bug that constructs the model differently | RLS is **database-layer** enforcement — the same class of guarantee this course keeps returning to, and the reason DALT-0074 (see `FINDINGS_LEDGER.md`) treated a working-looking global-scope-shaped fix as a severe defect rather than a style choice |
| no first-party partitioning support — Eloquent models map to one table; partitioning a MySQL/Postgres table underneath one is a manual DBA operation Laravel does not model | `PARTITION BY RANGE`, child tables, and `DROP TABLE` for instant deletion are written directly against Postgres, with no framework layer to configure |
| **`pg_cron`'s closest bridge is the task scheduler** (`Schedule::call(...)->daily()`, defined in `routes/console.php`) — but the scheduler runs *PHP*, triggered by one system cron entry (`* * * * * php artisan schedule:run`) calling out to the app process | `pg_cron` runs *SQL* directly inside Postgres itself, with no PHP process, no HTTP server, and no application code involved at all — a categorically different place for the job to live, not just a different syntax for scheduling it |

The RLS-vs-global-scope comparison is the one to internalize: they solve the identical stated problem ("don't let a developer forget the tenant filter") from two different trust boundaries. A global scope trusts every future line of application code to go through Eloquent correctly. RLS trusts the database connection's role instead — which is exactly why the superuser trap above ("no error, no warning, policies are simply not applied") is the load-bearing lesson here, not the `CREATE POLICY` syntax.
