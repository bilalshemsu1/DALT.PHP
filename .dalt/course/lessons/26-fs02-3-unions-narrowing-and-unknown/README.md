## Why this matters

FS02.2 wrote down which values the application allows. That is the model. This lesson is about the other half: **at this exact line, which of those possibilities are still open?**

That question is what makes typed code pleasant rather than defensive. Without narrowing you write guards the compiler cannot see and access properties it cannot vouch for, and `as` starts creeping in as a way to say "trust me". With narrowing, the guard you already wrote *is* the evidence, and the compiler tracks it for you.

It also introduces the most important type in the course. `unknown` is how you say "a value arrived and I have not proved anything about it yet" — the honest starting point for every server response, every parsed JSON body, every form field. FS02.5 is built entirely on it.

## Before you start

Required:

- FS02.2 — Modeling application data.
- Node and npm, and an editor with TypeScript support.

Recommended first:

- Have your FS02.2 `Issue` model to hand. The narrowing examples use the same finite unions.

Going deeper in DALT Core — optional:

- None.

## By the end

You should be able to:

- explain how a runtime check changes what the compiler knows below it;
- narrow `null`, `undefined` and truthiness deliberately rather than by habit;
- discriminate between object alternatives using a shared literal field;
- say why `unknown` is safer than `any`, and what it demands before use;
- write a small type guard and explain what its return annotation actually promises;
- model states so that a contradictory combination cannot be written down;
- use an exhaustiveness check to make the compiler find every place a new variant was forgotten.

## Predict before reading

Write answers down first.

1. `if (typeof value === 'string')`. Inside that block, what does TypeScript believe about `value`? What about in the `else`?
2. `if (issue.title)` — what values does that check reject besides `undefined`?
3. A value is `unknown`. Can you read `.length` from it? What about if it were `any`?
4. You add a fourth member to a status union. Which `switch` statements will the compiler complain about, and which will silently fall through?

Question 4 is what exhaustiveness buys you, and question 2 is where a real bug hides.

## Mental model

Narrowing is the compiler following your runtime checks:

```text
value: string | null            ← what the type says is possible

if (value === null) { … }       ← evidence
                                  inside: null
                                  after:  string

typeof value === 'string'       ← evidence
value.trim()                    ← now allowed, because you proved it
```

Two things follow.

**The check is not overhead.** You would have written `if (value === null)` anyway. Narrowing means the compiler reads it too, so you never need a second, type-level assertion saying the same thing.

**`unknown` is `any` with the honesty left in.** Both accept every value. `any` then lets you do anything with it and reports nothing; `unknown` lets you do nothing until you prove something. That difference is the whole reason `unknown` is the right type for data arriving from outside your program.

## Narrowing is ordinary JavaScript plus a TypeScript consequence

The runtime check is still normal JavaScript. TypeScript adds a useful consequence: it
remembers what the check proved on each branch.

```ts
function describeId(id: string | number): string {
  if (typeof id === 'number') {
    return \`numeric issue id: \${id}\`;
  }

  return \`visible issue key: \${id.toUpperCase()}\`;
}
```

Before the `if`, `id` may be a string or a number, so string-only operations are not
safe. Inside the first branch, the check proves `number`. After that branch returns,
the remaining path is `string`. You did not learn a special TypeScript version of
`typeof`; you wrote JavaScript evidence and the checker followed it.

Use this order when a union feels confusing:

1. List every possibility in the union.
2. Choose a runtime fact that separates one possibility.
3. Put the code that needs that fact inside the matching branch.
4. Let an early return or an `else` remove the possibility from the remaining path.

## Evidence changes what TypeScript knows

FS02.2 asked which values the application allows. This lesson asks what we know about one particular value at this line of code.

~~~sh
mkdir -p .dalt/workspace
cp -R .dalt/course/fullstack/typescript-narrowing-lab/starter .dalt/workspace/fs02-3-typescript-narrowing-lab
cd .dalt/workspace/fs02-3-typescript-narrowing-lab
npm ci
~~~

Open src/narrowing.ts. A union declares several possibilities:

~~~text
string | number
        ↓ runtime evidence: typeof value === 'string'
string
~~~

TypeScript narrows because JavaScript has established evidence, not because we asked it to trust us.

## Start with all possibilities

In src/stages/union.ts, predict which operations work on string | number: toUpperCase, multiplication, String(value), and equality checks. Run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:union
~~~

Only operations safe for every remaining possibility work before narrowing. String(value) and equality comparison are safe; string-only and number-only operations are not.

In normalizeIssueIdentifier, hover value before the branch, inside the number branch, and after the early return. Then change the branch to test typeof value === 'string', typecheck, and put it back.

~~~sh
npm run typecheck
~~~

The early return matters: after the number path returns, TypeScript knows the remaining path is string. It follows ordinary JavaScript control flow, not formal theory.

## Narrow null, undefined, and truthiness deliberately

FS02.2 distinguished absent, undefined, and null. Retrieve that model here. Predict what each establishes:

~~~ts
value === null
value !== undefined
value == null
~~~

The loose equality example is deliberately narrow: value == null is true for null or undefined, so its false branch excludes both. It is not a recommendation to use loose equality generally.

Now run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:truthiness
~~~

The code compiles, but labelCount(0) returns No count. Truthiness is runtime evidence, yet it may not express the domain rule: 0 and empty string can be meaningful valid values. Use explicit equality when you mean existence rather than truthiness.

## Narrow object alternatives

An IssueLookup can be one of two object shapes:

~~~ts
type IssueLookup =
  | { issueId: number }
  | { issueKey: string };
~~~

Before writing a branch, ask what runtime evidence distinguishes them. Add a temporary function using 'issueId' in value, hover value inside each branch, typecheck, then remove it. The in operator establishes which object shape has the relevant member.

For built-in runtime classes, instanceof can also be evidence:

~~~ts
catch (error: unknown) {
  if (error instanceof Error) console.log(error.message);
}
~~~

Error exists at runtime. An interface or type alias does not. Therefore value instanceof Issue cannot work when Issue is only a TypeScript declaration; FS02.1’s erasure rule still applies.

## Unknown asks for proof

Predict the two lines in src/stages/unknown.ts, then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:unknown
~~~

any permits the operation and disables much of TypeScript’s protection for that value. unknown blocks the operation until a check proves enough. Neither word changes JavaScript runtime; unknown gives the checker useful work to do.

In describeUnknown, hover value before each condition and inside the string, number, null, and user-summary paths. Add a temporary object literal such as { id: 7, name: 'Amina' } to src/exercise.ts and run npm run run.

Use narrowing, not as, !, or any, to make an operation safe. A non-null assertion such as value!.name merely tells TypeScript to assume; it supplies no runtime evidence. Treat it as an escape hatch after asking whether control flow or the model should handle absence instead.

## Extract evidence into a small guard

Repeated checks can become a reusable type guard. In isUserSummary:

~~~ts
function isUserSummary(value: unknown): value is UserSummary
~~~

the predicate tells TypeScript what a successful runtime check establishes. Run the valid and invalid examples:

~~~sh
npm run stage:guard
~~~

Now temporarily replace the guard body with return true. Will TypeScript reject it as dishonest? No. A type predicate annotation is not automatic validation; TypeScript trusts the predicate’s claimed relationship. Its implementation must actually prove id and name.

## Make contradictory state hard to express

Consider a weak state model with isLoading, hasError, issues?, and error?. It permits loading and error simultaneously, success without data, and other states the application did not design.

Before reading the replacement, list which states you actually want. Then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:state
~~~

The starter’s IssueLoadState instead describes alternatives:

~~~ts
type IssueLoadState =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; issues: IssueSummary[] }
  | { status: 'error'; message: string };
~~~

status is a discriminant. Checking state.status narrows to a variant and makes only that variant’s data available. success without issues, error without message, and loading with success data fail because they are not valid modeled states. This improves typed source; untrusted runtime input can still be wrong.

## Exhaustiveness finds an old assumption

describeLoadState handles every state and ends with:

~~~ts
const exhaustive: never = state;
~~~

At that point nothing should remain if every variant was handled. never is only useful here as an exhaustiveness check; do not generalize it beyond this job.

Predict what happens when a refreshing state retains existing issues. Then run:

~~~sh
npm run stage:exhaustive
~~~

The new variant makes the existing handler incomplete. The compiler exposes the old assumption: it believed the listed cases were all possible. Add the refreshing member first, typecheck before changing the switch, then deliberately add its handler.

## Try it

**Prediction:** `describeLoadState` ends with `const exhaustive: never = state;` inside its
`default` case. Before running anything, predict what happens to that exact line — not the
new variant's own case, the *old* `never` line — the moment you add a `'refreshing'` member
to `IssueLoadState` and change nothing else.

**Run / inspect:** add the member, leave the `switch` untouched, and run `npx tsc --noEmit
--strict`.

**What happened:** a compile error appears, but not where a new-variant bug usually
announces itself. It lands exactly on `const exhaustive: never = state`, reporting that a
`{ status: "refreshing"; ... }` value is not assignable to `never`.

**Why:** every case before `default` narrows `state`'s type by elimination; by the time
control reaches `default`, TypeScript's model of "what `state` could still be" is supposed
to be empty — that is what `never` means. Adding a variant nobody handles yet means one real
possibility survives into `default`, so assigning it to a variable typed `never` is a
contradiction the checker can name precisely. This is the entire value of the pattern: the
error does not say "you forgot something" in the abstract, it names the unhandled variant at
the exact line that assumed there were none left, before the missing branch ever ships.

## Common mistakes

### Truthiness where you meant "not null"

`if (issue.title)` also rejects the empty string; `if (count)` also rejects `0`. Answer to question 2: `''`, `0`, `NaN` and `false` all fail a truthiness check. Compare explicitly — `!== null`, `!== undefined`, `.length > 0` — unless you genuinely want all falsy values excluded.

### Reaching for `as` instead of a check

`(value as Issue).title` compiles and proves nothing. If you know enough to write the assertion, you know enough to write the check — and the check narrows for free.

### Using `any` to get moving

`any` disables checking for everything downstream of it, silently and transitively. Answer to question 3: `unknown` refuses `.length` until you prove it; `any` allows it and tells you nothing. Reach for `unknown`.

### A type guard that does not check what it claims

```ts
function isIssue(value: unknown): value is Issue {
  return typeof value === 'object';   // ✗ claims far more than it proved
}
```

The `value is Issue` annotation is a promise to the compiler, not a check. A guard whose body is weaker than its signature is an `as` with extra steps — and a more convincing one. Severity: high.

### A `default` case that hides the new variant

Adding `default: return 'unknown'` to a `switch` makes it compile forever, which is exactly why the compiler stops telling you about a new status. Answer to question 4: only the exhaustive ones complain; the ones with a `default` fall through silently.

### Modelling states as independent booleans

`isLoading`, `isError` and `data` as three fields allow `isLoading: true, isError: true` — a state your application has no meaning for. A discriminated union makes it unwritable.

## When this goes wrong

1. **The narrowing "disappeared".** Something between the check and the use could have changed the value — often a function call, or reading through a mutable property rather than a local `const`. Assign to a local first.
2. **`Object is possibly 'null'` after you checked.** You checked a different expression, or checked `a.b` and then used `a.b.c` where `a.b` is a getter the compiler cannot assume is stable.
3. **A discriminated union will not narrow.** The discriminant must be a literal type on every member, not `string`.
4. **Exhaustiveness check does not fire.** The `never` assignment must be in the `default` branch, and the switch must have no other `default` behaviour swallowing the case.
5. **`unknown` blocks everything and it is tempting to give up.** That is the type working. Prove one property at a time — FS02.5 makes this a routine.

## Focused exercise — prove, model, then evolve

**Mode: self-reported practice using your editor, tsc, and Node. This exercise is not automatically verified.**

Begin with npm run typecheck and npm run run. Then work in src/narrowing.ts and src/exercise.ts:

1. For normalizeIssueIdentifier(value: unknown), change the contract so positive integer numbers and numeric strings become numbers; null, objects, and invalid strings return null. Use typeof and explicit checks—no any or blind assertion.
2. Use isUserSummary to accept one valid local object and reject one invalid object. Temporarily make its predicate return true; explain why the compiler cannot prove that lie.
3. Write down why the old multi-boolean load state permits contradictions. Keep the discriminated union and add one intentional impossible object literal to observe the diagnostic, then remove it.
4. Add refreshing with issues to IssueLoadState first. Run typecheck before changing describeLoadState. Read the never error, then handle refreshing deliberately.
5. Run npm run typecheck and npm run run after repair. Hover values before and inside at least two narrowing branches.

### Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1 — look for runtime evidence</summary>

Ask what JavaScript can establish about this value: typeof, explicit equality, in, or instanceof Error.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2 — do not weaken the model</summary>

unknown needs proof. A new state variant means the switch is old, not that the exhaustive check should disappear.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3 — choose a discriminant</summary>

One literal status field can identify each state. Put issues and message only on the variants that require them.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4 — small shape clue</summary>

A refreshing member needs status: 'refreshing' and issues: IssueSummary[]. Its switch case can report how many issues remain visible.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reference explanation — reveal after an honest attempt</summary>

The normalizer first proves a number or string case, then rejects invalid values explicitly. The guard’s checks—not its predicate annotation—make a user summary trustworthy. A discriminated union moves data into the state where it is meaningful, so contradictory boolean combinations cannot be expressed. Adding refreshing must break the never check until the handler understands it.
</details>

## Debug the remaining possibilities

When a narrowing error appears, ask: What is declared here? What possibilities remain at this line? What runtime evidence exists? Is truthiness excluding 0 or empty string? Am I about to use as, !, or any to silence feedback? Did a predicate truly prove its claim? Did a new union member make a handler incomplete?

## Closed-book checkpoint

Answer before revealing the comparison answers.

1. What does string | number mean before narrowing?
2. Why can typeof change what TypeScript knows?
3. Why does an early return narrow the remaining path?
4. What protection does unknown preserve that any gives up?
5. Why can if (value) be wrong for a count where 0 is valid?
6. Why is value instanceof SomeInterface not generally possible?
7. Why can a custom predicate lie?
8. Why can a discriminated union be better than multiple booleans?
9. An upload can be idle, uploading, success with a URL, or error with a message. Why is that union safer than isUploading, isSuccess, url?, and error??

<details>
<summary>Reveal comparison answers</summary>

1. Either possibility may be present, so only shared-safe operations work.
2. JavaScript’s runtime test is evidence that lets the checker eliminate alternatives.
3. The returned branch cannot continue, leaving only the other possibility.
4. unknown requires proof before unsafe use; any opts out of much checking.
5. Truthiness treats 0 as false even when it is a real count.
6. TypeScript-only declarations are erased and are not runtime constructors.
7. TypeScript trusts the predicate annotation; its implementation is responsible for truth.
8. Variants place required data with the state that needs it and remove contradictory combinations.
9. Each allowed upload state has exactly its required data; invalid combinations are harder to express.
</details>

## In the project

### DALT connection — request state is a union

When the browser eventually asks DALT for issues, the screen is not simply “data” or
“not data”. It moves through meaningful states:

```ts
type RequestState<T> =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: T }
  | { status: 'error'; message: string };
```

The `status` field is a discriminant. If it is `'success'`, `data` exists; if it is
`'error'`, `message` exists. That is safer than four unrelated booleans such as
`isLoading`, `hasData`, `hasError`, and `isIdle`, where contradictory combinations are
easy to create.

This lesson only models the state. Part 04 will connect it to actual HTTP and DALT
responses; FS02.5 explains why the response must be parsed before it becomes `data`.

Discriminated unions are how **B02** models anything with alternatives, and the pattern recurs constantly after that: request state in Part 04 (`idle | loading | success | error` — not three booleans), authentication state in Part 06, and every operation that can succeed or fail with a reason.

`unknown` matters even more. It is the type every value crossing into your program should start as, and FS02.5 turns that from a principle into a routine. When Part 04 receives a JSON body from DALT, `unknown` is the honest starting point and narrowing is the road out of it.
